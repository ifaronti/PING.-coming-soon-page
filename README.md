## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process
I used HTML/CSS my JS codes were written in my HTML file. The process leading upto this was just for me to know I'm going to use flexbox to center everything, use gap a little then use position a little to put everything together, according to the design image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
margin and flexbox/grid's gap properties are not to be used together unless margin for x-axis and row gap for y-axis. otherwise, if you have a design image (not figma file) you are trying to align your CSS with, that practice will batter your time and leave you with a serious burnout unless of course you know the exact the units' values.


### Continued development
To continue building on my CSS's highly motivated improvement. Also to keep getting better with CSS.


### Useful resources

- [perfect pixel](FireFox Extension) - This helped align my contents close to the design image provided with its design image overlay on my output helping me put my contents accordingly.
